# Technology Stack: Dear Adeline

## 1. Overview

This project is built using a modern web development stack, leveraging TypeScript for both frontend and backend operations. The focus is on creating a scalable, performant, and AI-integrated learning platform.

## 2. Core Technologies

*   **Programming Language:** TypeScript
    *   **Rationale:** Chosen for its strong typing capabilities, which enhance code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity in a complex application.

*   **Frontend Framework:** React with Next.js
    *   **Rationale:** React provides a robust component-based architecture for building dynamic user interfaces. Next.js extends this by offering powerful features like Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and API routes, optimizing performance and enabling a unified full-stack development experience.

*   **Backend / API:** Next.js API Routes
    *   **Rationale:** Utilizes the integrated API routes provided by Next.js, allowing for seamless backend logic development within the same framework as the frontend, simplifying deployment and development workflow.

*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
    *   **Rationale:** A powerful open-source platform providing a PostgreSQL database, real-time capabilities, authentication, and an easy-to-use API, accelerating backend development and ensuring robust data management.

*   **AI/ML Integration:** Anthropic AI SDK and Google Generative AI
    *   **Rationale:** Integration with cutting-edge AI models from Anthropic and Google enables the core AI learning companion features, providing personalized and intelligent educational experiences.

*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
    *   **Rationale:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development and highly customizable designs directly within the markup, ensuring a consistent and maintainable visual style.
