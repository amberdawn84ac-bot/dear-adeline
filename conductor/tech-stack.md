# Technology Stack

## Overview

This project is built using a modern web development stack, leveraging JavaScript/TypeScript for both frontend and backend operations, with a strong focus on scalability, developer experience, and AI integration.

## Core Technologies

*   **Programming Language:** TypeScript
    *   **Rationale:** Provides static typing for improved code quality, maintainability, and developer tooling, crucial for a complex educational platform.

*   **Frontend Framework:** React with Next.js
    *   **Rationale:** React offers a component-based architecture for building interactive user interfaces efficiently. Next.js extends React with features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes, optimizing performance and SEO, and enabling a full-stack development approach within a single framework.

*   **Backend / API:** Next.js API Routes
    *   **Rationale:** Utilizes Next.js's built-in API routes for backend logic, providing a seamless development experience and allowing for direct integration with frontend components and database interactions.

*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
    *   **Rationale:** Supabase provides a powerful PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities, authentication, and an easy-to-use API. This simplifies backend development and offers robust data management for user profiles, learning progress, and project data.

*   **AI/ML Integration:** Anthropic API
    *   **Rationale:** Integration with Anthropic API enables advanced AI capabilities, such as the AI learning companion and other intelligent features, aligning with the platform's core offering of personalized, AI-powered learning.
